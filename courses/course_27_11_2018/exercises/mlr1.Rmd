# Machine Learning with R at LRZ: Introduction to mlr

## Spam E-mail Database


--------------------


### Description

A data set collected at Hewlett-Packard Labs, that classifies 4601 e-mails as spam or non-spam. In addition to this class label there are 57 variables indicating the frequency of certain words and characters in the e-mail.

### Format

A data frame with 4601 observations and 58 variables.

The first 48 variables contain the frequency of the variable name (e.g., business) in the e-mail. If the variable name starts with num (e.g., num650) the it indicates the frequency of the corresponding number (e.g., 650). The variables 49-54 indicate the frequency of the characters ‘;’, ‘(’, ‘\[’, ‘!’, ‘\\$’, and ‘\\#’. The variables 55-57 contain the average, longest and total run-length of capital letters. Variable 58 indicates the type of the mail and is either `"nonspam"` or `"spam"`, i.e. unsolicited commercial e-mail.

### Details

The data set contains 2788 e-mails classified as `"nonspam"` and 1813 classified as `"spam"`.

The “spam” concept is diverse: advertisements for products/web sites, make money fast schemes, chain letters, pornography... This collection of spam e-mails came from the collectors' postmaster and individuals who had filed spam. The collection of non-spam e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence the word 'george' and the area code '650' are indicators of non-spam. These are useful when constructing a personalized spam filter. One would either have to blind such non-spam indicators or get a very wide collection of non-spam to generate a general purpose spam filter.

## Exercise



a) Create a binary classifcation task from the spam data

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(mlr)
data(spam, package = "kernlab")

spam.task = ...
```

b) List all learners that could be trained on `spam.task`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
```

c) Select a learner you like and create it. If you want to can change its hyperparameters

```{r, eval = FALSE}
```

d) Create an index set of train and test indicies. The test set should have 1000 observations.

d*) Ensure that the fraction between `"spam"` and `"nonspam"` is the training and test set is the same as in the full dataset.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
train.inds = ...
test.inds = ...
```

e) Train your model on the train subset of the spam data and predict on the test subset.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mod = ...
preds = ...
```

f) Evaluate the performance of your model based on accuracy and area under the curve.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
perf = ...
```

g) Try to find a model with an AUC of at least 98%.
- Try different models
- Change hyperparameters
- Have a closer look at the feature and try to find transformations or combination of features that improve your model's performance

```{r, eval = FALSE}
```
